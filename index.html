    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Peter Griffin lives in a humble McMansion style home in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island. Not much is known about his early childhood except the fact that he was born in Mexico. Due to conflicting information, it is assumed that he is between the ages of 43 and 58.</p>
